            <p >I am a pre-final year B.E. Computer Science and Engineering student at St. Josephâ€™s Institute of Technology, currently maintaining a CGPA of 9.51. I have a strong foundation in C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack. I am passionate about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and actively improve my problem-solving skills through platforms like LeetCode. I am looking for internship opportunities to gain hands-on experience, apply my knowledge to real-world projects, and learn from industry experts. I am eager to explore new challenges, collaborate with teams, and grow as a developer. ðŸš€</p>
